# deno-chat: A Chatbot Kickstarter

A basic framework for working with Open AI's Chat API.

## Features
ðŸ™‹ Ask AI anything with a simple **askAI** function
ðŸ¤– Create bots with distinct instructions.
ðŸ’¬ Persist memories in long chat sessions.

## Usage

The main component in this modules are:
1. An **askAI** function that makes it easy to ask ChatGPT anything and get immediate answer.
2. A **Bot** class that allows custom system instruction, and makes it easy to send and receive messages with ChatGPT in a multi-turn conversation.


### Ask AI anything:

```ts
import { askAI } from "https://deno.land/x/deno_chat/mod.ts";
const botResponse = await askAI("List 5 fruits that start with the letter 'a' in JSON. Respond only in JSON.");
console.log(botResponse);
```
```
{
   "fruits": [
      "Apple",
      "Apricot",
      "Avocado",
      "Acai",
      "Acerola"
   ]
}
```

### Create an AI with unique system instructions

```ts
import { Bot } from "https://deno.land/x/deno_chat/mod.ts";
const marvin = new Bot({ instruction: "Always respond as if researching an article for the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" });
const responseFromMarvin = await marvin.ask(
  "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?",
);
console.log(`Marvin says, "${responseFromMarvin}"`);
```
```
Marvin says, "According to the fictional novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42. However, this answer was provided by a highly advanced computer named Deep Thought, and it remains unknown what the actual question was. Therefore, the search for the true meaning of life, the universe, and everything continues."
```
### Multi-turn conversation (with a chat session)

```ts
const dan = new Bot({
  instruction: "Always ask questions to help the user think for themselves.",
});

const firstResponseFromDan = await dan.ask(
  "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?",
  {
    chatId: "123456789",
  },
);
console.log(`Dan says, "${firstResponseFromDan}"\n\n`);

const secondResponseFromDan = await dan.ask("Just tell me the answer.", {
  chatId: "123456789",
});
console.log(`Dan says, "${secondResponseFromDan}"\n\n`);

// Reset the chat session
dan.reset("123456789");

// Now ask again
const responseFromDanAfterReset = await dan.ask(
  "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?",
  {
    chatId: "123456789",
  },
);
console.log(`Dan says, "${responseFromDanAfterReset}"`);
```
```
Dan says, "That's a philosophical question that has puzzled people for centuries. What do you think the meaning of life, the universe, and everything is?"


Dan says, "According to Douglas Adams' book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything is 42. However, the book also points out that the characters do not know what the question actually was. So, the meaning of life, the universe, and everything remains a mystery."


Dan says, "That is a philosophical question which has been debated for centuries. What do you think the answer could be?"
